# Texas-Housing-Market-Dashboard-

Developed a comprehensive data visualization tool for Texas housing market analysis using R Shiny, providing interactive insights for policymakers and real estate professionals.

The dashboard was designed with a primary focus on policymakers who require data-driven insights to shape housing regulations, economic policies, and urban planning initiatives. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the dashboard presents key market trends in an intuitive format, allowing users to identify patterns, assess affordability, and anticipate shifts in the housing sector. My role involved selecting relevant metrics, designing clear and impactful visualizations, and interpreting findings to support strategic decision-making.
